<para><simplesect kind="note"><para>There is a premade repl, ready for use which was built using the steps above. If you wish to use this repl simply <ulink url="https://github.com/alanlichen/dpp-on-repl">visit this github repository</ulink> and click the &quot;Run on Replit&quot; button. Then, follow the steps in the README file.</para>
</simplesect>
To build a D++ bot in a repl.it instance, follow these steps. These steps are slightly more convoluted than installing D++ into a standard container as we don&apos;t have access to root in the conventional way or write access to any files outside of our home directory in a repl. This guide sidesteps the issue by locally extracting a libdpp deb file installer, and referencing the local dependencies from the command-line.</para>

<listitem><para>Use wget, or the upload button, to get the precompiled x64 release into your repl as a file, e.g. <computeroutput><ulink url="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/releases/download/v10.0.1/libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb">https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/releases/download/v10.0.1/libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb</ulink></computeroutput></para>

<para>Now that your bot is running, you have to keep it online. Replit automatically puts repls to sleep after some time, so you will need to ping a webserver. Unfortunately, Replit is sometimes limiting, and this is one of the only free workarounds to this issue.</para>

<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<para>If the bot fails to start and instead you receive an error message about being banned from the Discord API, there is little to be done about this. These bans are temporary but because repl.it is a shared platform, you share an IP address with many thousands of bots, some abusive and some badly written. This will happen often and is outside of the control of yourself and us. However, you can try to migitate this by typing <computeroutput>kill 1</computeroutput> in the shell. This is not guaranteed to work, and you might need to try it a few times. If it still does not work, then we recommend instead you obtain some affordable non-free hosting instead.</para>
<para>If your bot continues to fall asleep even though you have a server, we advise you to double check that no errors are happening, and if the server is being pinged. If that still does not work, we again recommend you to obtain some affordable non-free hosting. </para>
