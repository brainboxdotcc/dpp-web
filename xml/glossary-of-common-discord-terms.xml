    <title>A Glossary of Common Discord Terms</title>
    <briefdescription>
    </briefdescription>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>This is a list of terms that you should know if you want to use D++ (or any other Discord library). These terms are not D++ specific, and are commonly used throughout most of the Discord developer community. This list, with a few exceptions, <emphasis><bold>is Discord specific</bold></emphasis>, that is to say that this is not an explanation of commonly used C++ terms, it is for people who are not familiar with the terminology of the Discord API and libraries themselves.</para>

<title>Glossary</title>
<para>Listed in alphabetical order, with terms in bold, here are the basics on...</para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><bold>Action row</bold>: A collection of up to five <bold>components</bold> which is attached to a message.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><bold>Application Command</bold>: See <ref refid="glossary-of-common-discord-terms_1slashcommand" kindref="member">slashcommand</ref>.</para>

</listitem><listitem><para><bold>Bot token</bold>: A secret string of characters that is used as a &quot;login&quot; to your bot.

</listitem><listitem><para><bold>Callback</bold>: While not strictly related to Discord, it is used a LOT in D++. A callback is when a function is passed to another function, sort of like how you might give someone a telephone number (you give them the means to do some sort of interaction rather than asking them how to interact), which is used to handle responses to <bold>events</bold>.</para>

</listitem><listitem><para><bold>Guild</bold>: What the Discord API (and most libraries for it) call a server.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><bold>Intents</bold>: The right for a bot to receive certain data from the Discord API.</para>
