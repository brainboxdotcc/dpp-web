<title>Is this library in production use?</title>
<para>This library powers the bot <ulink url="https://sporks.gg">Sporks</ulink> which has over 2600 severs. We are also under progress of changing over our much larger bot <ulink url="https://triviabot.co.uk">TriviaBot</ulink> which has 88,000 servers and 8.1 million users to D++ from Aegis. These bots server as the acid test to prove that the library is production ready for bots of all sizes.</para>

<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md10">
<title>How much RAM does this library use?</title>
<para>During testing this library takes approximately 32 megabytes of ram to cache 250,000 users and 2200 guilds, with their respective roles and emojis. We will update these figures as we continue to test.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md11">
<title>How much of the library is completed?</title>
<para>All REST calls (outbound commands) are completed including slash commands, and all Discord events are available. The library also has voice support.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md12">
<title>How do I chat with the developers or get help?</title>
<para>The best place to do this is on the <ulink url="https://discord.gg/RnG32Ctyq7">discord server</ulink>. You most likely won&apos;t get an answer immediately (we have lives, and need to sleep sometimes), so feel free to lurk and join the community!</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md13">
<title>How can I contribute to development?</title>
<para>Just star and fork a copy of the repository, and submit a Pull Request! We won&apos;t bite! Authors of accepted pull requests get a special role on <ulink url="https://discord.gg/RnG32Ctyq7">the support server</ulink>.</para>

<title>Whats the best way to learn C++?</title>
<para>A simple search can find some learning tools, however not all are good. Here is a list of learning resources:</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md15">
<title>Do I need to be an expert in C++ to use this library?</title>
<para>NO! Definitely not! We have tried to keep things as simple as possible. We only use language features where they make sense, not just because they exist. Take a look at the example program (<computeroutput>test.cpp</computeroutput> and you&apos;ll see just how simple it is to get up and running quickly). We use a small subset of C++17 and C++14 features.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md16">
<title>Why is D++ also called DPP</title>
<para>DPP is short for <emphasis>Discord Plus Plus</emphasis> (D++), a play on the Discord and C++ names.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md17">
<title>Is D++ a single header library?</title>
<para>No, D++ is a classically designed library which installs itself to your library directory/system directory as a shared object or dll. You must link to its .lib file and include its header files to make use of it. We have no plans for a single-header build.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md18">
<title>Does this library support slash commands/interactions?</title>
<para>Yes! This library supports slash commands. For more information please see <ref refid="slashcommands" kindref="compound">Using Slash Commands and Interactions</ref>.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md19">
<title>Is the library asynchronous?</title>
<para>All functions within D++ are multi-threaded. You should still avoid doing long operations within event handlers or within callbacks, to prevent starvation of the threads managing each shard. Various blocking operations such as running files and making HTTP requests are offered as library functions (for example <ref refid="namespacedpp_1_1utility_1a329ced24b62e56f2f137e2db637497f6" kindref="member">dpp::utility::exec</ref>)</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md20">
<title>Does this library support voice?</title>
<para>Yes! This library supports voice and will automatically enable voice if your system has the libopus and libsodium libraries. When running <computeroutput>cmake</computeroutput> the script will identify if these libraries are found. See the example programs for information on how to send audio.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md21">
<title>Does this library support sharding?</title>
<para>Yes! D++ supports sharding and also clustering (grouping of shards into one process) to ensure it is scalable for small and large bots alike.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md22">
<title>How do I contribute to the documentation and website?</title>
<para>The documentation and website are built using Doxygen. To contribute to site pages, submit a Pull Request to the main repository. The site pages can be found within the <computeroutput>docpages</computeroutput> directory. Details of classes, variables, namespaces etc are auto generated from Doxygen comments within the library source code in the <computeroutput>include</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>src</computeroutput> folders.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md23">
<title>What version of the Discord API does this library support?</title>
<para>D++ Only supports Discord API v8, the latest version.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md24">
<title>Does D++ require C++20 support?</title>
<para>No, at present we do not use any C++20 features. Some C++17 features are used, which are available in all recent compilers.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md25">
<title>When I start my bot i get an error: &quot;error while loading shared libraries: libdpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&quot;</title>
<para>To fix this issue, as root run <computeroutput>ldconfig</computeroutput>: <computeroutput>sudo ldconfig</computeroutput>. Log out if your SSH session and log back in, and the bot should be able to find the library.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="md_docpages__z_01__f_a_q_1autotoc_md26">
<title>When compiling with voice support, i get an error: &quot;No rule to make target &apos;sodium_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND&apos;, needed by &apos;libdpp.so&apos;. Stop.&quot;</title>
<para>The libsodium package requires pkg-config, but does not check for it when installed. Install it as root, e.g. <computeroutput>sudo apt install pkg-config</computeroutput>. Rerun cmake again, and rebuild the library. </para>
